            <h3 class="h3">What is anime?</h3>
            <p>
              <br />
              Anime, or Japanese animation, is one of the biggest media
              distributions from Japan. The first things that might come to mind
              when hearing the word are probably big eyed, blue haired people
              making too much noise. And that thought would completely be
              correct… in some instances. Of course, the Anime industry has a
              lot more to offer, and asking “what is Anime?” is the equivalent
              to asking what a movie is. Movies can’t be lumped into one
              category, as there are many different types to choose from, just
              like anime.

            <h3 class="h3">Anime is a cartoon, isn’t it for kids?</h3>
            <br />
            <div>
              Just like America, Japanese animation has ratings that range from
              TV-PG to TV-MA and everything in between. It’s sort of similar to
              the reasoning behind Family Guy or The Simpsons which are shows
              definitely not for children but also definitely a cartoon. There
              are many high schoolers and even adults who watch anime, and there
              are many people at Winter Springs High School who do as well.<br />
              <br />
              Sophomore Xander Hale, said “Anime can be filled with many adult
              themes and stories that a kids show would never have.”<br />
              <br />
              If looking past the fact that these shows are just drawings on the
              screen, it’s easy to see that there is a lot more than meets the
              eye.

              Yeah, but it’s in Japanese. Who wants to read subtitles?
            </h3>
            <br />
            <div>
              Many Animes have something called a “dub” or a voice over that’s
              in English for all the characters. Many people may beg to differ,
              but these dubs can be just as accurate as the subtitles and can
              make the story easier to understand for Western watchers. Not only
              this, but reading subtitles isn’t as bad as it seems. If push
              comes to shove and a show doesn’t have a dub ready to listen to,
              reading subtitles can actually be beneficial, believe it or not.
              According to Reading Rockets, “closed captioning can support a
              host of foundational literacy skills.” Learning while also
              enjoying a TV show is something everyone should take advantage of.

            <h3 class="h3">The culture is too different. Isn’t it weird?</h3>
            <br />
            <div>
              On the note of learning and developing skills, there is also the
              factor of getting an understanding of the Japanese language and
              culture. Japan may be different than America, but watching Anime
              will open up a ton of knowledge on even the simplest things, like
              what Japanese people eat, how their school system works, or how
              they interact with each other. Non-anime watchers may even find
              some similarities between them and people across the whole globe,
              which is definitely something cool to see.
